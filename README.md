# CNNCompression

## Description
Compressing a CNN reduces the number of parameters and subsequently, the computational complexity. This allows for faster inference after the model is trained. Tucker decomposition can be used to matrix factorize the convolutional layers and reduce the computational complexity.

## Code
This Jupyter Notebook explores the effectiveness of compression via Tucker decomposition.
